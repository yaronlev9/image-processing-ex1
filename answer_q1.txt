Q1 answer:
if we create a division of grey levels between zi to z(i+1) and there are no pixels marked with those
levels in the histogram in that area we might get 0 pixels. when calculating the qi that is between the zi
and the z(i+1) we will divide by the sum of the histogram of that area, and if the sum is zero we will divide by
zero that will give us an error. that is why when the q array is too big we will divide to smaller segments
and the chance to get a segment with zero pixels increases.
